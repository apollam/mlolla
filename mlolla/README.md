# MLolla

This folder contains the heart of this library which is all functions and classes 
needed to when following the typical Machine Learning flow: 

`Data Acquisition > Data Exploration > Data Transformation > 
Model Training > Model Evaluation > Model Tuning > Model Deploy.` 

Also included are the tests and validations.

Each folder has their own README explaining their contents.
