# Notebooks

This folder is meant to be used to gather all of the data exploration and experimentation
using Jupyter Notebooks. 

When exploring and experimenting, you can use all of the functions, classes and transformers MLolla 
provides, being those: preprocessing, train_factory, output, metrics, etc. For this, you can use 
the following code in the beginning of your notebooks:

```
import sys
sys.path.append("../")
```
